# cdn

Temporary asset host for product imports.

- **Purpose:** Prototype CDN bridge for Shopify image import.  
- **Indexing:** Search engines are blocked via `robots.txt`.  
- **Structure:**  
```bash
cdlp/
packshot/ → brand-provided product images
model/ → packshots with model
lifestyle/ → lifestyle images
```



This repo may later evolve into a permanent CDN, but for now is a prototype bridge.
